Welcome to Sandwich Heaven! I love sandwiches, but I get tired of having the same old thing. Which is why I'm creating an app for people to share their favorite sandwich recipes.

# Backend

    Data:
        - build migrations
        - build seeds
        - db config
        - knexfile
        - server file
        - index file
    API:
        - build models - users and posts
        - build routers - users and posts
        - build middleware - users and posts
    Utils:
        - AxiosWithAuth
        - URL

# Frontend

    - Login --- add auth token
    - Logout --- take away auth token
    - User card with their own posts --- require auth
    - Post card
    - Create Post --- require auth
    - Landing page that gets posts

## Stretch

    - Edit posts --- auth
    - Delete posts --- auth
    - Search bar function
    - Like/Save sandwiches
    - Add comments
    - Rank your favorites
